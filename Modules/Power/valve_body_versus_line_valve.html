      <font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">I see a lot of questions about Shift 
      Kits, Line Modulator Boost Valves and Accumulators. As a transmission 
      repairman I'd like to share my thoughts on the subject.</font></b></p>
                        <p style="margin-left: 40; margin-right: 40"><b>
      <font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">What most people are looking for in 
      transmission strategy is a quicker, firmer shift, or more technically a 
      shorter shift duration. Shift duration is how long it takes for a shift to 
      occur, or the amount of time that the clutches are slipping. A shorter 
      shift duration has a performance feel, and generally is better for the 
      clutches, because the wear on the plates happens during this "slip."&nbsp; 
      Shortening duration also will reduce heat, which is responsible for most 
      automatic transmission failures. The way to reduce shift duration is to 
      increase the engagement pressure of fluid to the clutch during the shift.</font></b></p>
                        <p style="margin-left: 40; margin-right: 40"><b>
      <font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">One way to raise Line Pressure is to 
      use a mechanical shift kit, or more simply, a set of valves and springs in 
      the accumulator valve body. Since the accumulator is hydraulically 
      "downstream" of the EPC, a mechanical shift kit does not interrupt any 
      lubrication failsafes and since it is using a mechanical pressure boost 
      (through the Line Pressure Boost Valve) it does not place any additional 
      load on the pump. I have seen 3 basic variations of mechanical shift kits, 
      a "Line Pressure Mod Valve" ($89-$99), a "3 springs and a valve (about 
      $150, basically a Line Mod Valve and 3 additional springs) and a full 
      accumulator ($200, a Line mod valve, springs, lower control springs and 
      lower control valves installed into a new or rebuilt accumulator valve 
      body). I'm not going to be coy about it, I designed, build and indirectly 
      sell the Factory Tech/PSP Accumulator Shift Kit, so instead of trying to 
      act neutral (I'm not) I'll tell you why I think the kit I build is a 
      better kit, a better value and better for your transmission.</font></b></p>
                        <p style="margin-left: 40; margin-right: 40"><b>
      <font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">First, an accumulator is a fairly 
      straightforward assembly. In the 4R100, there are 3 shift bores, and 1 
      line pressure/throttle bore. The 3 shift bores are identical, and 
      different springs are set in them to control the reaction of the 
      accumulator piston to hydraulic pressure, this reaction translates into 
      shift duration on the shift controlled by that bore. All of the bores are 
      fed pressure by the Line Modulator Boost Valve, which reacts to the 
      Throttle Valve, controlling this circuit boosts line pressure into all of 
      the shift bores. If you change the Line Modulator Boost Valve and raise 
      line pressure throughout the body, the individual shift bores are no 
      longer "tuned" properly and the reaction in the shift bores will be out of 
      calibration for the elevated line pressure. For this reason, you need to 
      recalibrate the shift bores, both in the top circuit (above the 
      accumulator piston) and below (the 321-310 circuit). Also, in the 2001 
      model Lightings, I have found that increased pressure in the lower 
      circuits caused the 321 valves to "side load" or bind up due to asymmetric 
      application of hydraulic pressure during the shift, resulting in a "bang 
      shift". A Line Mod valve fails to address these conditions. My last (but 
      not least) concern with a Line Mod valve is cost, I don't think you get 
      much bang for the buck if you pay $89 for a Line Modulator Boost Valve. 
      I've been very upfront about this, I use a part very similar to this as 
      part of the Factory Tech/PSP Accumulator Shift Kit. In may ways, I think 
      the part I use is higher quality, my valve and sleeve are made from 
      stainless steel and most of the other ones I see have aluminum sleeves. 
      This can cause problems in the long run too, as the steel valve cycles 
      though an aluminum sleeve, the sleeve wears faster than the valve and 
      after a time this results in pressure loss and sloppy shifts, the 
      condition the part is designed to correct. Also, of all the parts I have 
      personally seen, only the one I use has an O-Ring seal to prevent pressure 
      leaking out of the circuit. For all this, my cost for the valve is about 
      $20, if you just want a boost valve, email me, I'll sell you one for $30, 
      shipping included, and in a year I'll still be here if you need a new 
      transmission, my Monster Box goes for $1500.</font></b></p>
                        <p style="margin-left: 40; margin-right: 40"><b>
      <font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">The second popular option is the 3 
      springs and a valve shift kits. Using this type of kit recalibrates the 
      upper circuits to the elevated line pressure, but still ignores the side 
      loading of the lower control valves. The kit of this type that I have seen 
      also uses an aluminum sleeve/steel valve, and again, the cost is high, for 
      the extra $50 give or take, you get 3 springs and more detailed 
      instructions.</font></b></p>
                        <p style="margin-left: 40; margin-right: 40"><b>
      <font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">For the Factory Tech Accumulator Shift 
      Kit, I start with a new Accumulator Valve body, Genuine Ford Part 
      (F81Z-7G422-AA, List Price at your dealer is $150 +/-), I add a Line 
      Modulator Boost Valve (about $20), recalibrate the upper circuit with 
      different springs ($12) and upgrade the lower circuit springs and use a 
      valve designed to cycle more freely in the bore to prevent both side 
      loading and binding. (I won't tell you the price, a guy has to have a few 
      secrets). Well, to tell the truth, I don't pay list on the other parts 
      either, but between the kits and my custom transmission work I buy a lot 
      of parts and I get some good discounts (buy 50 accumulators at a time and 
      you can get the same discount, prolly). My point is, I've heard from quite 
      few people who bought the other kits and asked themselves (and me) "Is 
      this it?, I paid $XXXX for this?" I honestly hope that no-one ever got one 
      of my kits and asked that question. The fact is, the final retail price of 
      the Factory Tech/PSP Shift Kit is less than the list price of the 
      components that go into it, and my distributor makes a profit, too.</font></b></p>
                        <p style="margin:0 40; "><b>
      <font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">And finally, I have my reputation. Read the "mods" on bulletin boards to 
      see who my customers are, do a search for Factory Tech, and after you see 
      who they are, E-Mail them and ask how they like the kit. As of this 
      writing, I've sold or given away (for the first year I made them for 
      people I work and didn't even charge them above what I paid for parts) 
      about 500 accumulators and exactly one customer has let me know he wasn't 
      satisfied, and in the end I even satisfied him. (he had installation 
      issues, after the part was in right, he loved it). When the '01 Lightings 
      first came out, the side loading issues on the lower circuit became 
      evident, and I replaced 2 units after I redesigned the accumulator. Other 
      than these cases, I know of NO customers who have had complaints about my 
      parts. Just consider this, if you buy XXX parts, and have a problem, 
      what's the chance of you getting the home number of the guy who designed 
      it? If you bought it used off of E-Bay? If you have one of my parts and 
      you have a problem, I'll fix it. That means if it needs to be replaced, 
      you get a new one, no matter where you got it, it means that if you have a 
      question about installation or performance that you can't get a good 
      answer to, you can get in touch with me and if I need to talk to you to 
      make it clear, I'll send you my home number, or call you. There is no one 
      selling parts for Lightnings that has built more 4R100s than me, I know 
      this box and I stand behind what I build, because I want to sell you that 
      Monster Box when you want it, when you're ready for it, not when you 
      grenade the tranny and need it.<br>
