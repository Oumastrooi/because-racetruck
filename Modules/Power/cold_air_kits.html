                      an inferior air filter?).&nbsp; In fact, Richard Holdener's recent article in MM&amp;FF seems to indicate that the stock airbox is fine until airflow needs are significantly higher

                      <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tahoma">I had the Swanson $300. open air filter setup with nice billet aluminum MAF adapter and anodized aluminum
                        brackets and air diverter. Very nice quality. I always wondered about the IAT though. So I did some
                        datalogging yesterday and since I thought I knew what was going to happen I had ordered an Airaid
                        system to replace it.
                        <br>
                        <br> It was 83 degrees yesterday and today when I tested. I drove the exact same 40 mile round trip with
                        a mix of in-town and rural 55-65 mph open roads.
                        <br>
                        <br> Yesterday I had the Swanson 4" by 9" open K&amp;N filter and their brackets and panels which supposedly
                        block and divert hot fan air from the filter on the truck. Once going and up to temp the IAT1 temps
                        (at the MAF) were at least 17-18 degrees above ambient. The IAT2 temps (after the intercooler) were
                        between 25 and 30 degrees above that. So for a cruise on an 83 degree day the IAT1 temps were at
                        about 100 degrees with the IAT2 temps between 125-130 degrees. This was the best case while at a
                        steady cruise of at least 55 mph and no stop lights. Swanson told me they stay within 10 degrees
                        of ambient.
                        <br>
                        <br> When you got into traffic the temps rose quickly. Averaged 30-40 degrees above ambient with the
                        below 45 mph heavy traffic and occasional red lights. Saw a high of 130 degrees (47 degrees above
                        ambient!) sitting at a couple of lights. The IAT's stayed about 25-30 above this which put them over
                        150 degrees at points, and we're not under any boost yet. What surprised me the most was that the
                        IAT1 temps took so long to drop even when moving in traffic. I mean literally miles to get 4-6 degrees
                        of drop. I had to run at 55 mph without stopping for about 10 miles to get them back to 17 to 20
                        degrees above ambient again.
                        <br>
                        <br> Today I installed the Airaid. I've heard good and bad, but figured it had the exact same filter
                        as the Swanson and was basically enclosed, drawing air through the (probably) too small factory hole
                        in the fender well. I am planning on adding a fresh air hose to the box for additional cool air,
                        but decided to go ahead and try it just to see if there was a difference.
                        <br>
                        <br> Same exact route and same temp today so it was a very even comparison. On the open road section
                        my IAT1 temps were within 3-4 degrees of ambient for an improvement of 13-14 degrees. The IAT2 temps
                        were the same 25-30 degrees higher, but of course were lower than the open filter due to the IAT1
                        temps being so much lower.
                        <br>
                        <br> In town traffic and stop lights saw the same temp rise as before, but never exceeded 22 degrees
                        over ambient, versus up to 47 degrees over with the open filter. Most of the time they remained 12-15
                        degrees over ambient. But the biggest difference was in how fast the temps dropped when you pulled
                        away from the light. Before it took miles (literally) to see a 6 degree drop in temps at the IAT1.
                        With the enclosed unit they dropped 10 degrees within a 1/4 mile tops, and dropped the rest of the
                        way to 3-4 above ambient within 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile. HUGE difference as the IAT2 temps are so much
                        improved due to the lowered IAT1 temps.
                        <br>
                        <br> It's basically like jumping on your truck on a 65 degree day versus jumping on it on a 85-90 degree
                        day. There's (on my truck) a 20-25 degree reduction on the in-town slower speed stuff and 14-15 degree
                        reduction out on the open road.</font>

                      good, increases the delightful blower whine, and is easier to clean with the optional "Outerwear" filter
                      cover.
