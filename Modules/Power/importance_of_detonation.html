											"Knock is virtually always the cause of failure in a supercharged engine." "The pressure spike caused by the [detonation]
											explosion can reach several thousand PSI, and pressure rise is rapid enough to be considered an impact load. These
											temperatures and pressures are almost ten times higher than those accompanying controlled combustion. . . No metals
											in existence today, no forged pistons, no special head gaskets can withstand sustained detonation."</font>

											<br> Further, the load on a rod is a mixture of tensile loads at the top of the compression and exhaust strokes and
											compressive loads during the power stroke. Yet on the power stroke, the compressive load of combustion helps to
											mitigate the tensile loads, which are unchecked during the exhaust stroke. Thus, the tensile loads on a con rod
											are greatest when at TDC on the exhaust stroke, where it is purely a function of piston weight, RPM, and stroke
											-- not boost.
											<br>
											<br> Bottom line: At 14 PSIG, peak rod pressure is only up about 20%. See Bell, pp. 21-24. With detonation, peak rod
											pressure is up about 1,000%.</font>

										<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">The Ford engineers use Kisler probes to watch cylinder pressures in real time. Detonation has a distinct pressure
											spike. This spike can be 100% greater than normal and still not be heard. Under these inaudible detonation conditions,
											if a rod is marginal, it will break. You now have a broken rod and no audible detonation.
