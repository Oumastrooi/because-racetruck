      <i><font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF"> <b>The main reason for the boost bypass is to protect the transmission. Full 
      boost and eight cylinders are hard on the tranny during the 1 - 2 shift. 
      When stock, the engine cuts to four cylinders and the boost bypass 
      activates for the 1 - 2 shift at WOT. The duration of both the bypass and 
      four cylinder mode is about 1/2 second. The engine recovers nicely from the 
      four cylinder mode, but the S/C takes longer to recover from the loss of boost.

      Again, it's the tranny that comes up a little short, not the engine (the 
      engine is protected by the rev limiter - stock anyways). Defeating the 
      boost bypass and/or the four cylinder mode may shorten the life of the 
      tranny. <br>

      Again, transmission. How long the tranny will last with the boost bypass 
      and the four cyl mode defeated depends on several variables. How often do 
      you WOT the 1 - 2 shift, and how much have you increased the overall boost 
      are the two most important questions. Also, never back off from WOT at the 
      shift. The tranny "slam shifts" into 2nd, and doesn't like it. <br>
      <br>
      Recommendations for best tranny life without sacrificing performance: <br>
      1. Defeat the boost bypass by bypassing the solenoid valve with vacuum 
      line. <br>
      2. If you run a chip - a) have the duration of the four cylinder mode shortened 
      to around 0.2 sec, but do not defeat entirely; b) do not raise the shift 
      RPM by much, if any; c) do not raise the rev limit by much, if any. <br>
      3. Install valve body in tranny (for less slippage and heat buildup during 
      shifts). <br>
      <br>
      Notes: <br>
      * If you put better rods in the engine, you can raise the rev limit and 
      shift RPM. <br>
      * If you have the tranny built (better clutch packs), you can think about 
      defeating the four cylinder mode entirely. <br>
      <br>
      The "recommendations" are good for "daily driver."&nbsp; For a "daily driver," 
      the 
      "notes" are probably going a bit overboard. <br>

      Do some searches for "Transmission" / "Tranny" here and on NLOC and you 
      will get an idea of what it takes to tear one up. <br>

      Now, when the PCM sees something it doesn't like (Rev Limiter Hit,

      Ford (SVO/SVT) did put the 4 cylinder knock out and boost vent on the 1-2 
      for a reason; to prolong the life of the transmission. But it has been out 
      experience (now on the 4th transmission), that those concerns are not 
      warranted on a fairly stock truck (chip, filter, and small pulley).&nbsp; 
      But when you do run large amounts of boost and/or nitrous, blowing clutch 
      packs will be a problem. <br>

      My advice for a fun daily driver that can still rip up the strip pretty 
      hard with out risking damage would be: a chip (tuner of choice), filter

      <i><b>Ok, there is some good info and some not 
      so good info in this post. I will try to address all the questions here in 
      one post, sorry if I am repeating what someone has already said on certain 
      parts. <br>
      <br>
      </b>What, exactly, does a boost bypass do?</i><b><br>
      <i><br>
      The boost bypass is a vacuum activated valve that has a butterfly plate 
      inside the blower case. When vacuum is applied, the bypass opens and 
      allows air to bypass the blower rotors. <br>
      <br>
      </i></b><i>Why, exactly does it do it? </i><b><i><br>
      <br>
      There are several reasons. One as previously described, is to vent boost 
      off on sudden decel. This is more damaging on a centrifugal blower like a 
      Vortech, but on a roots blower, it's not too healthy either and can cause 
      premature rotor gear wear. Another reason is to reduce heat. With no 
      bypass, the blower would be constantly heating the intake charge. Anyone 
      here who's ever owned a Gen 1 Lightning or Mustang with a 1500 Kenne Bell 
      blower (no bypass) will tell you that you can cook your breakfast on it. 
      And some have even had their IAT sensors max out (256 degrees) using those 
      blowers with no bypass. With the bypass open, you don't superheat your 
      intake charge when you see vacuum, which is 90% of the time you are 
      driving. <br>

      <br>
      I don't think these two questions are valid questions, because it appears 
      there is some serious confusion going on here . . . <br>
      <br>
      There seem to be three different things being discussed in this thread, 
      that some people think are all the same thing. <br>
      <br>
      </font>
      <a href="./boost_bypass_valve.html" style="text-decoration: none">Boost Bypass</a><font color="#FFFFFF"> - this is what I described above. It's the vacuum activated 
      valve that allows air to bypass the blower rotors. </font> </i></b>

      this is somewhat inaccurate--</font><a href="./boost_bypass_valve.html"><font color="#FFFFFF">the bypass</font></a><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
      allows the air from the rotors to circle back to the other side of the 
      rotors rather than building up positive manifold pressure]<b><i><br>
      <br>
      Boost Dump Solenoid - this is an electrical solenoid that can vent boost 
      off if the PCM commands it. <br>
      <br>
      The $25 bypass kit - this "bypasses" the dump solenoid, giving normal 
      control to the boost bypass, and not allowing the PCM to shut it off. <br>
      <br>
      As for WHY we have a device that would kill boost on the truck, here goes 
      . . . The PCM monitors everything that is going on with the drivetrain. 
      There are several "failsafes" (7, I believe) that if the PCM sees, it will 
      kill boost to the motor, in order to decrease power output. The main 
      reason people started disconnecting the boost solenoid, is a failsafe 
      called Brake Torque. This failsafe occurs when the PCM sees the brake 
      pedal applied, and the throttle at WOT, also known as a burnout. When you 
      are at the track, and you do a burnout, then make your pass, and the truck 
      hits second gear and kills boost, then you run a 16 second ET, that's 
      because of the Brake Torque failsafe
      <img alt="" src="./torque_reduction/smile.gif" border="0" width="15" height="15">. There are several other ones, 
      such as excessive misfire, high ECT temp, malfunctioning sensor default, 
      high trans temp, rev limit, and a few others. Contrary to what some 
      believe, there is NO overboost failsafe. The PCM does not sense boost, and 
      there is no sensor on the truck that reads boost. The boost solenoid is 
      not there to kill power to the trans on shifts, that is done through the 
      PCM via Torque Reduction (kills injectors). However we've noticed on the 
      01s that there does seem to be a boost dump occurring on the 1-2 shift if 
      you don't disconnect it. <br>
      <br>
      As for damage that could occur from disabling the solenoid . . . Well, 
      I've stated most of the important failsafes above. If you are going to 
      disable yours, whether it's with a vacuum bypass kit or just unplugging 
      the solenoid, you should just be aware that if those issues arise, the PCM 
      won't be able to kill boost. But also keep in mind that the PCM does take 
      other action during failsafes other than killing boost. <br>
      <br>
      Hope this helps.</i></b></font></font></p>
