										<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tahoma">When I started investigating the spring rubbers, I opted to stay on the conservative side in terms of hardness
											due to the added stress it puts on the springs themselves outside where they are supported.&nbsp; My intentions
											was to first test with one on each spring and then add a second one.&nbsp; The ride height increase with one rubber
											is 1/4" or less and the results are very positive.&nbsp; Next, I will add a second one and keep playing with my
											shock setting.&nbsp; My non-scientific calculations with 2 rubbers should take the spring rate from 665 to about
											850lbs. (total # of coils and remove 2 with consideration to a certain amount of give depending on the hardness
											of the rubbers).&nbsp; With everything else being so stiff including the shocks, it is still necessary to be able
											to transfer weight otherwise you end up with a drift vehicle. </font>

										<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tahoma">The spring rubbers that I am using are sold by BSR # MRG 1287 and are described as rear rubbers because they are
											grooved on both sides.&nbsp; The distance between the bottom of the grooves is 7/8".&nbsp; With these rubbers
											you are basically taking out 1 loop for each rubber and the rest of the spring will compensate somewhat.&nbsp;
											I haven't tried this but I am hoping that the increase in ride height will be no more than 1/2" with both on (low
											density rubber).&nbsp; Hard poly will be less compliant and will result in increased ride height.&nbsp; If anyone
											uses other types, I would be very interested to hear your impressions but I am very pleased with the results so
											far.&nbsp; With all my other changes, I have built a great all around suspension with excellent adaptability and
											few compromises. </font>
