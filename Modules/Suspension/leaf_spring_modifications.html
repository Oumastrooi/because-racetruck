			best to drill the frame mounting 
			holes before the plates are welded.&nbsp; It would be difficult to 
			chuck these up on a drill press after they are welded.&nbsp; The 
			upper holes of the side plates are right up against the intersection 
			of the top plate.&nbsp; I 
			mocked them up with c-clamps, and used a sharpie to trace the holes 
			and mark the line of intersection between the plates.</font></b></p>
                        <p><b><font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">Once removed, and the 
			holes drilled (with my trusty Unibit), I used magnetic triangles to 
			square everything up.&nbsp; The braces can then be cut.&nbsp; After 
			everything was cut and mocked up with the magnets, it was easy for 
			the welder to weld everything up without making any mistakes.&nbsp; 
			I just set the assemblies on the welding table and walked away.</font></b></p>
                        <p><b><font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">I then mounted the sliders 
			to the frame to mark the locations for the sliders.&nbsp; It's 
			important to note that the leafs are not perfectly parallel to the frame, 
			so it's not possible to mount the sliders perfectly parallel to the 
			edge of the plates without inducing bind.&nbsp; 
			Using a framer's square held against the leafs, you trace the line 
			of the leafs onto the underside of the sliders.</font></b></p>
                        <p><b><font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">Then hold the sliders 
			roughly in place, and mark for the first hole.&nbsp; The sliders should be 
			installed to where the springs are at about 1/3 of their travel at 
			rest.&nbsp; In other words, the rear spring eyes have 1/3 of the 
			slot to go forward on extension, and 2/3 of the slot to go backwards 
			on compression.</font></b></p>
                        <p><b><font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">To minimize bind, and 
			ensure that the sliders are as parallel to the leafs as possible, the best 
			practice is to then mount the sliders to the leafs, and the one 
			hole, and put weight on the frame to force the leafs to compress.&nbsp; 
			Then check to make sure that the lines that you scribed before are 
			accurate, and drill the remaining holes.&nbsp; I used 1/2-13 flange 
			bolts and flanged locking nuts to mount the sliders to the frame.</font></b></p>
                        <p><b><font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">Since I used Flex-A-Form 
			springs drilled for 1/2" bolts, they mated right up to the sliders.&nbsp; The 
			stock springs may need custom bushing work.&nbsp; Energy Suspension 
			and Prothane make just about every kind of bushing and sleeve you 
			can imagine.&nbsp; Also note that the F-A-F leafs are slightly 
			longer than the stock leafs, so the sliders must be a little further 
			back to keep with the 1/3-2/3 rule above.</font></b></p>
                        <p><b>
			<font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">For the Flex-A-Forms, I had to 
			rework the rear bushings if I wanted to use the aluminum bushings 
			supplied with the sliders.&nbsp; I bored out the bushings to 15/16" 
			(a snug fit for the aluminum pieces), and then used a small belt 
			sander to remove the flange portion of the bushings.&nbsp; Since the 
			F-A-F bushings do not fit snugly into the eyes, I smeared a coating 
			of black RTV in the bore, then inserted the bushings, then applied 
			pressure with a 4" c-clamp to swell the urethane into contact with 
			the inside of the bore, and left it overnight to dry.&nbsp; Seems to
