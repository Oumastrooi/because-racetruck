      35 pounds, but it is semi-unsprung

      The S-A-L weigh

      are lighter than the Metcos, it's not by much.&nbsp; Additionally, 
      the front spring eye on the leaf springs must be replaced with an 
      aluminum bushing, which mean that the leafs obviously have to be 
      removed, taken to a shop with a press, and replaced.&nbsp; And many 
		suspension experts advise against making the front eye solid on anything 
		but a drag car (see <a href="./suspension_systems.html" style="text-decoration: none">
