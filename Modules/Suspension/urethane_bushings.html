											to Prothane, the special urethane grease is only special in that it is
											thicker and stickier, so it lasts longer.&nbsp; Regular grease is fine,
											but it just won't last.&nbsp; So unless you are drilling for zerk
											fittings, you have to use urethane grease.&nbsp; You will need extra --
											the little tubes that come with bushings are never enough.&nbsp; Also,
											according to Prothane, most urethane squeaks come from the <i>sides</i>
											of the bushings, so make sure to liberally coat the sides.</font>

										<font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">After much research, I assembled
											mine with anti-seize between the bushings and the shells, and
											urethane grease between the pins and the bushings and between the end
											caps and the bushings.&nbsp; If (or when) I get squeaks, I will lube
											with regular chassis grease applied through zerk fittings.</font>

								<p>
									<b>
										<font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">One important thing to remember
											is that urethane bushings operate in a completely different way from
											stock.&nbsp; The stock rubber bushings are solidly attached to both the
											outer (control arm) sleeve and the inner sleeve, and the inner sleeve is
											clamped down and prevented from moving, so the suspension movement is <i>
												the result of the rubber twisting</i>.&nbsp; With urethane bushings, the
											inner sleeve actually rotates inside the urethane.&nbsp; So with the
											stock rubber bushings, there is nothing moving, as nothing needs
											lubrication.&nbsp; But with urethane bushings, the interface between the
											bushing and inner sleeve (and also the outer mushroom-shaped caps) needs
											to be lubricated.</font>

											surface with lots of little dings and ridges.&nbsp; I took the time to
											sand them clean, paying special attention to the ridge created by the
											seam (when installing, I pointed the seam at the center of the truck).</font>
