          <font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">I work for Moroso Performance and 
          am the very proud and satisfied owner of a 2002 Lightning. We have 
          just completed four projects for Lightnings using my truck as the 
          guinea pig. <br>
          <br>
          Based on our very recent experience, the stock oil pan cannot be 
			removed without removing or loosening the transmission unless you 
			are willing to damage the oil pan. The stock pan can be removed with 
			the transmission in place if you are willing to bend the rear 
			portion of the rail.<br>
          <br>
          On a Lightning, if you pick the engine up near the front (after 
          disconnecting engine mounts and loosening the transmission mounts) you 
          can get the pan out by bending the rearmost portion of the pan rail 
          downward. This is of course assuming that you are planning to replace 
          the pan or are very skilled at knocking things back into their 
          original shape! <br>
          <br>
          When the oil pan bolts are removed, the pan can be pushed rearward 
          enough to allow access to the two 8 MM screws that hold the forward 
          portion of the oil pump pickup in place. The pan can also be jockeyed 
          around enough to allow access to the 12 MM screw (I'm referring to the 
          size of the hex on the screws) that hold the rear mount of the pickup.&nbsp; Once the pickup is disconnected, the pan and pickup can be removed at 
          the same time. Believe me, we tried everything we could to avoid 
          taking the transmission out, but once we had it loosened up it made 
          more sense to take it down so we could have more room to work. <br>
          <br>
          After we completed the work we did an experiment and that is when we 
          discovered that the stock pan could be removed if we were willing to 
          hurt it a little. <br>
          <br>
          The new pan has been designed so that you can install and remove it 
          without disturbing the transmission.&nbsp; Put another way, if I can do it, 
          anyone can!&nbsp; If you have someone with small hands handy, you will find 
          that to be an advantage.&nbsp; If not, you will most likely find new ways to 
          expand your vocabulary of expletives. <br>
          <br>
          So, right now I have a really trick aluminum oil pan that adds two 
          quarts to the system and an aluminum transmission pan that is huge (I 
          tow my race car with the Lightning) residing beneath the truck. Our 
          Lightning specific parts should be ready in 4 to 5 weeks so watch for 
          the release. Sorry for the semi-commercial, but we make great parts 
          here at Moroso and it's difficult not to talk about them.</font></b></i></p>
