		oil, can be overcooled -- if the fluid is too cool, it does not properly

		One of the reasons that OEMs integrate tranny coolers into the radiator

		<b><font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">"Automatic transmissions have 
		internal filters designed to capture only large particles. These filters 
		are designed as a pickup to keep large particles from flowing through 
		the transmission. These filters are on the suction side of the pump. 
		Fine filtration in the pan is not an option for the transmission 
		manufacturers due to the fact that transmission pumps should not be 
		restricted. The only way to get fine filtration for a transmission is 
		with an external transmission filter kit on the push side of the pump. 
		The 4R100/E4OD and many other transmissions were never equipped with 
		this type of external filter. The Allison in the Chevy and many medium 
		duty and heavy duty trucks come equipped from the factory with an

                        <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px"><i><b>
		<font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">How it works: Our filter is on the 
		"push" side of the pump. This location allows for a filter with 
		increased efficiency -- or smaller micron rating. Normally, you have the 
		dirty fluid in the pan. The OEM filter hopefully catches the really big 
		particles before it enters the valves and pump. After running through 
		the transmission, it leaves as "dirty" fluid. This fluid will have 
		clutch dust and other impurities which are all normal in any automatic 
		transmission. This dirty fluid would be recirculated back to the pan. 
		With our kit you can catch dirty fluid BEFORE it makes back to the pan. 
		Keeping the fluid clean, keeps your valve body clean which keeps your 
		transmission shift quality at its highest. After installation of our 
		external kit the filter in the pan now acts simply as a pickup for the 
		pump and virtually never needs changed. </font></b></i></p>

		<font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">Answer: There isn't a rating on the 
		OEM filter. If you had to rate it, according to Baldwin, it would be 
		about 100 microns. It's basically a screen. 22 microns is smaller than 
		the smallest clearance in the transmission. We could definitely put a 
		smaller micron filter on the housing, but the result would be less oil 
		actually filtered in each pass as more fluid would pass through the 
		bypass port because of increased resistance to flow through the filter. 
		Because the 22 micron element was small enough to keep the system clean 
		and allow all the fluid to be filtered in a single pass, it was the 
		perfect choice." </font></b></i></p>

		that the R rated [i.e., racing] filters like the 51515R should only be 
		used for racing applications and shouldn't be used on street driven 
		applications.&nbsp; He said that they're meant to be used for a few runs 
		at the track and then changed out, not for a DD.&nbsp; We got to looking 
		in the catalog and the filter that we came up with is the NAPA Gold 1622

      "To understand stall torque converters, one needs to first understand the 
      how the stall of a converter is determined. The stall of a converter can 
      be determined by placing the transmission in forward gear, applying and 
      holding the brakes, and depressing the throttle until the engine can no 
      longer increase RPM or the brakes no longer hold the vehicle. The maximum 
      RPM the engine developed is considered the stall speed of the converter."&nbsp;

      Muscle Mustangs and Fast Fords states that: "When powerbraking our 
      Lightning (with the stock tires in place), the stock converter stalls to 
      approximately 1200 mm. Rev it higher and the tires will spin. Our new 
      Precision converter is designed to stall between 2400-2600 rpm, and that 
      should help quarter-mile ET."&nbsp; See also
