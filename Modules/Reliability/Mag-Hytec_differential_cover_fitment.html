          conflict with the mounting piece for a panhard bar (such as the Ruslow 
          bar pictured above).&nbsp; The panhard mount needs to be 
          extensively ground down to accommodate the thicker shell of the 
          Mag-Hytec.&nbsp; Additionally, the Mag-Hytec uses stainless allen bolts to 
          install, which are to be torqued to no more than 16 ft. lbs. to avoid 
          overcompressing the o-ring seal.&nbsp; Even though the panhard mount is only 
          subjected to lateral loads, I was concerned that the stainless bolts 
          would not provide enough support to securely hold the mounting bracket.&nbsp; Consequently, I 
          attached the panhard mount directly to the diff cover.&nbsp; This way, 
          all of the diff cover bolts work together to take the shear load.</font></b></p>

      the panhard mount which interferes with the fit against the diff cover.&nbsp; 
      This is tricky, as the diff cover has radiused corners where the sides 
      meet the mounting flange.&nbsp; It took about an hour of grinding to get 
      it right.&nbsp; It might be simpler to just space the mount out a little 
      from the diff cover.</font></b></p>

      slopes away a little, meaning that the panhard mount will not be perfectly 
      parallel to the cover-to-diff mounting surface, but it's just a little 
      off.&nbsp; I quit when the four top mounting holes were just about lined 
      up--maybe 1/16" off and elongated the holes on the panhard mount  just 
      a little so that the bolts could slip through.&nbsp; This was easier than 
      removing 1/16" more material from the mount.&nbsp; The image below shows 
      the underside of the mount.&nbsp; Note that the trick is to round off the 
      edge to conform to the radius of the Mag-Hytec.&nbsp; It gets a little 
      thin near the middle, but there will be six small bolts and four large 
      bolts holding it down.&nbsp; Recall also that the only real loads the 
      mount is subjected to are lateral, relatively close to the centerline of 
      the long part.</font></b></p>

      I used HELP! branded "5/16 universal transmission pan bolts" (part # 
      45660), which I just happened to have around.&nbsp; They were perfect!&nbsp; 
      They are 5/16-20 threaded and measure approximately 39/64" in threaded 
      area.&nbsp; They have a large flange head with serrations to grab the 
      metal.&nbsp; While I don't think they are grade 8, they will only be 
      subjected to side loads and will be augmented by the four adjacent grade 8
