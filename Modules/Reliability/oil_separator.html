				designed to prevent oil from entering the intake and 
				supercharger assemblies on late model 1999 thru 2004&nbsp;Ford 
				Lightnings and Supercharged Harley Davidson trucks. On every one 
				of these supercharged vehicles, the intake and supercharger are 
				saturated with oil from the PCV system due to the high level 
				of&nbsp;negative pressure (Vacuum)&nbsp;created in the upper intake by the 
				supercharger, and elevated crank case pressure from piston ring 
				blow-bye, created from increased cylinder pressure by the 
				supercharger. Oil in the induction system of&nbsp;your engine can 
				create detonation issues and plug fowling, along with several 
				other issues including clogging the intercooler causing severe 
				horsepower lose and reduced fuel mileage, and in some cases 
				severe engine damage. Every one of these supercharged vehicles 
				should have had a system like this installed right from the 
				factory, but Ford never addressed</font></span></font><span style="font-family: Tahoma"><font color="#FFFFFF">

				oil separators plumbed with a spaghetti mess of tubing to 
				automatically drain the oil back into the valve cover and others 
				do not use a filter at all, they just delete some of the PCV 
				lines and reroute the rest trying to reduce the amount of 
				suction from the intake to the PCV system, causing high idle 
				issues and drivability issues, not to mention reducing the 
				efficiency of the PCV system. This kit works, and it has a true
