          Some experienced 
          Lightning road racers are of the opinion that the brakes do not need 
          ducts, especially my Brembos, but I want to be able to abuse the 
          brakes without worrying.&nbsp; I just don't think you can be too 
          careful with the braking capabilities of a 4,700 lb, 145 MPH vehicle.&nbsp; 
          Plus, street-compound pads can fade when overheated on the track.&nbsp; 
          If you don't want to run racing pads on your street car, ducts help 
          you get by with street pads on the track.</font></b></p>
