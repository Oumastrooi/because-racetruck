		<font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF" size="3">From day one, my F150 has had a soft 
		brake pedal.&nbsp; You pump it once and it�s solid as a rock!&nbsp; I 
		took it in to my selling dealership and the service manager and I test 
		drove a used 06 on the lot to see if it was just an 06 thing.&nbsp; I 
		was really hoping that this used reference truck didn�t have the same 
		issue as mine.&nbsp; Thankfully it didn�t (have the same soft pedal). 
		The reference truck had a nice solid pedal.&nbsp; David informed me that 
		he would �consult� with the engineers and get back to me. A&nbsp; week 
		later he called and said that the engineers couldn�t really isolate any 
		one component but offered a few suggestions.&nbsp; I dropped off the 
		truck yesterday and they ran a diagnostic on my brake booster.&nbsp; It 
		tested fine.&nbsp; They replaced the master cylinder and adjusted the 
		actuator rod (located between the booster and MC).&nbsp; I picked it up 
		tonight and PRESTO! Brakes feel just as they should.&nbsp; FIRM ON THE 
		FIRST PRESS !!!!!! </font></b></i></p>
                        <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; margin-top: 0"><i><b>
		<font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF" size="3">I know that there were a few here 
		that have already had the MC replaced and still have the soft pedal.&nbsp; 
		I can say from experience that if the MC and brake booster have already 
		been replaced, it more than likely is the actuator rod.&nbsp; I 
		installed a Wilwood aluminum race MC in my mustang and had to adjust the 
		actuator rod several times before it felt right.&nbsp; Adjust it too far 
		out and the brakes are actually engaged before ever touching the pedal.&nbsp; 
		Adjust it too far in and the pedal feels very soft, like air in the 
		lines.&nbsp; One could easily make this adjustment in their garage, but 
		why bother if it�s under warranty.</font></b></i></p>

		<font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF" size="3">The rod is located between the MC 
		and the booster; therefore you must pull the MC forward.&nbsp; You don�t 
		have to disconnect any lines unless they prevent the MC from moving far 
		enough forward.&nbsp; The Rod has a ball on the MC end that you would 
		turn with a wrench.&nbsp; Once the correct length has been determined, 
		cinch down the locking nut.</font></b></i></p>

		HOLY CRAP!!!!!!!!!!<br>
		<br>
		My brakes have sucked every since I bought this truck.<br>
		I adjusted my rod this morning and cant freakin' believe how much better 
		my brakes are. I started out with one full turn and that made a big 
		improvement but still not quite what I wanted.&nbsp; Adjusted it another 
		1/2 turn and HOLY MOTHER OF BRAKES!&nbsp; They felt awesome!&nbsp; Just 
		a tiny bit of pressure on the pedal gave firm, solid, fantastic braking!&nbsp; 
		After thinking about it for a few minutes, I was a little concerned that 
		they may drag being that tight so I back off my adjustment 1/4 turn.<br>
		<br>
		Bingo! 1 and 1/4 turn was the perfect length. It now has a tad of free 
		play yet the brakes are drastically improved, firm, solid.<br>
		<br>
		I highly recommend this to anyone with the spongy brake problem.<br>
