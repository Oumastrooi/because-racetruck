          allowing them to cool down enough before parking after some hot laps.&nbsp; 
          According to Stan: "The BIG thing to remember when you are driving 
          aggressively in open tracks or hard, is you have to do a cool down 
          where you are using the brakes a min. so they have time to gradually 
          cool down.&nbsp; Also need to make sure your wheel studs are torqued 
          down correctly."</font></b></p>

          used AutoSpecialty PowerStop cross-drilled rear rotors (part #'s AR-8559R, 
          AR-8559L).&nbsp; While cross-drilling is typically a bad idea (weakens 
          the rotor), they are a cosmetic match for the Brembo fronts and too 
          tempting to pass up.&nbsp; The 
          rear rotors are subject to minimal abuse anyway.&nbsp; I have not had 
			any issues with them.</font></b></p>

                            <b><font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">One handy tip for stuck rear 
          rotors from Sal Manella of Powersurge Performance:&nbsp; Soak the 
          rotors with WD-40 by squirting around the wheel studs and the 
          hub/rotor joint.&nbsp; Then strike the rotor with a metal hammer in 
          between the lugs and around the circumference of the hub part of the 
          rotor.&nbsp; Repeat this wd-40/hammer process two or three times, 
          allowing the WD-40 a few minutes to soak in each time.&nbsp; Then, 
          through the space for the caliper, knock the rotor free with a dead 
          blow mallet or a piece of wood placed on the rotor and struck with a 
          metal hammer.&nbsp; I confess that I eventually just hit the rotor 
          with a metal hammer because it was quicker and was tossing the rotors 
          anyway.&nbsp; Sal says this method works 100% of the time.&nbsp; 
          Worked for me, and my rotors were practically fused to the hub.</font></b></p>

			slotted or drilled.&nbsp; People correctly point out that drilled 
			rotors have a tendency to crack.&nbsp; But this is primarily true

			rotor specifically cast for cross-drilling, like Brembo GT rotors,
