		less than comforting. In addition to a massive amount of vibration, the 
		pedal actually sank toward the floor. This sinking continued the entire 
		time ABS was engaged and while it never completely ran out of travel, it 
		seemed awfully close to the floor by the time the truck had stopped

      distance is generally measured from (60 to 70mph), the test is primarily 
      testing the tire's grip on the pavement. As delivered from the 
      manufacturer, nearly all vehicles are able to engage the ABS or lock the 
      wheels at these speeds. Therefore, an increase in braking power will do 
      nothing to stop the vehicle in a shorter distance. For this reason, we do 
      not record stopping distances at this time. The Brembo systems will show 
      their greatest advantages when braking from higher speeds, or when tasked 
      with repeated heavy braking. The increased braking torque provides for 
      maximum deceleration at speed, and the ability to absorb and quickly 
      dissipate the intense heat generated during repeated braking insures that 
      the braking system will perform at the same high level each time. </font>

          am unsure of the clamping force, as this is a function of the 
          relationship between the master cylinder bore and the caliper pistons.&nbsp; 
          One neat thing abut the Brembos is that they use differential bores (40 
          and 44 mm), which provide for more linear application of braking 
          pressure.&nbsp; Note: these brakes will fit under the '01-'02 wheels, 
          but the calipers must be ground down a bit to fit under the '99-'00

                            <b><font face="Tahoma" color="#FFFFFF">Some have argued that the Brembos 
			actually increase stopping distances (see above).&nbsp; The theory 
          is that upsetting the balance of the front and rear brakes will upset 
          the ABS system and cause longer stopping distances -- at least in a 
          lockup-type panic stop -- because the rear 
          brakes will be relatively weaker.&nbsp; There is no question, however, 
          that the Brembos will shed heat much quicker than the stock brakes, 
          making them way more repeatable.&nbsp; The stock brakes will overheat 
          with a single 120-to-0 stop.&nbsp; The Brembos just keep on stopping.&nbsp; 
          I did notice much better pedal feel (probably just due to new pads),

          you.&nbsp; A few small differences in the calipers.&nbsp; #1 is the top 
          brace between the pads on the Stop-Tech, Brembo has none.&nbsp; This 
          greatly reduces caliper flex which can lead to uneven pad and rotor 
          wear.&nbsp; #2 the S/T caliper is a 4 piston caliper where all 4 
          pistons are 44mm in diameter.&nbsp; The Brembo caliper is also a 4 
          piston but uses a 40mm/44mm combination to compensate for the uneven 
          pad wear.&nbsp; #3 The S/T caliper is setup to use Porsche pads which are 
          available in an endless array of compounds and from many different 
          manufacturers (read cheaper pads).&nbsp; The Brembo uses Ferrari F40/F50 
          pads (read more $$).&nbsp; Keep in mind these differences are only under 
          extreme circumstances.&nbsp; The Brembo is a fantastic setup.&nbsp; I am no way 
          intending to badmouth them. I am merely offering my findings.&nbsp; Check 
          with S/T for any pricing. I did not buy the kit.&nbsp; I bought their
